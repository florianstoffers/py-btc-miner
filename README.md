# py-btc-miner

This is a simple implementation of a Bitcoin Miner in Python.
It works under Windows, running a Bitcoin Core Node (https://bitcoin.org/de/download).

The purpose of this Software is to learn how Bitcoin works, not to make money, but maybe I will try to add GPU support later for fun.

The Code was greatly inspired by https://github.com/luke-jr/python-blkmaker
